<h1>Projects</h1>

<p>On this page I will show you some of the projects that I have done. I do like shipping final products, however I also love experimenting with new technologies, for example this whole website is made using Blazor, doig thigs with the Graph API may not give a full product, since a lot of the new things that I try are in the testing phase so there are many bugs which limit the amount I am able to achieve, especially since I am trying from an non-employee perspective with limited resources</p>


@foreach (var project in projects.projects)
{

    <h1 style="margin-top: 20px;">@project.Title</h1>
    <p style="margin: 0; padding: 0;"><i>@project.Subtitle</i></p>
    <div style="min-height: 315px;">
        @if (project.ImagePath != null)
        {
        <p>
            
                    <iframe style="float: left; margin-right: 50px;" id="demo" width="560" height="315" src="@project.ImagePath" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


                    @project.Description
