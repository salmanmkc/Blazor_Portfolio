<h1>Projects</h1>

<p>On this page I will show you some of the projects that I have done. I do like shipping final products, however I also love experimenting with new technologies, for example this whole website is made using Blazor, doig thigs with the Graph API may not give a full product, since a lot of the new things that I try are in the testing phase so there are many bugs which limit the amount I am able to achieve, especially since I am trying from an non-employee perspective with limited resources</p>
