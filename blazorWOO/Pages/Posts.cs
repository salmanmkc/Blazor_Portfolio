I honestly was taken a step back and second guessed myself. Would I have thought that I would be an author when I was 9 years old, perhaps, but that's when I took a major turn in my life? I used to love writing stories, conjuring up a whole new universe and having complete control over someone's thoughts, actions and consequences without any backlash; the possibilities are endless.

I got so indulged in writing the book (much like I do with programming today) that I never ended up recording the audio for it. My teacher would give feedback to my mother saying that she got annoyed that I had flute lessons because I always left the stories on cliffhangers (although sometimes I did this for dramatic effect). That thought makes me smile, to have a story that brings that effect onto someone. I miss that, I miss being in a world of creativity, being able to bring a change to someone's life. As I have gotten better at programming I have been able to incorporate that creativity back, as well as through different mediums such as photography and music.", "/css/Assets/BlogImages/OneSmallChange/1.png", "Upon meeting Rob, he told me that I should write my own blog, put myself out there, document anything that I find challenging, as there will be other people in the same situation as myself who will have the same problems, the same hurdles, the same or more or less similar. That point really got me. I tend to read a lot of documentation and guides online. I like taking the reading approach to a lot of things, and I get used to how to interpret that information, however not everyone understands that, and I can relate to how it used to be at the beginning.

We need to stop caring about what other people think. Our value and self-worth are not decided by the views of other people, for all they could care about are of no importance to us either. Set your own goals, your own standards, and also keep your own judgements to yourself if you want others to do the same for you. I'm afraid there's no possible way to stop the influx of negativity that is projected by others onto us, let bygones be bygones. Instead, we have something better than that, the ability to control our own mindset and not let it affect us. I've encountered my fair share of bullying in my life, and the times where it has affected me the least is when I have ignored it and refused to pay attention to the matter and if serious enough, then report it. Bullies continue when they see they have an effect, it's a power trip for them. I like to take the moral high-ground and just not entertain their remarks. The main thing is the mindset. As Carol Dweck mentions in her book Mindset, your mindset is one of the most powerful things in the world. It can affect your well being, your relationships with others and even your education. If you think your ability is based off a test, and that your ability is static, then think again. If you think your IQ is a fixed measure of your intelligence, then think again. The psychologist Alfred Binet who co-created the IQ test himself believed that education and practice can bring fundamental changes to intelligence.

Let me know what you think down below. I will try to keep this up, as Rob mentioned to me, others may be able to relate, and I thoroughly agree with this.
