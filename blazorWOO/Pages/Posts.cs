I honestly was taken a step back and second guessed myself. Would I have thought that I would be an author when I was 9 years old, perhaps, but that's when I took a major turn in my life? I used to love writing stories, conjuring up a whole new universe and having complete control over someone's thoughts, actions and consequences without any backlash; the possibilities are endless. Yet, at the same time, you know exactly what will happen by the end of the story, or you can let them be a surprise for yourself (I personally prefer the latter), letting the flow overtake your writing into its own abyss.", "/css/Assets/BlogImages/OneSmallChange/0.jfif", "I remember this one time in my primary school, Montpelier; we all had to write a book and marked by a deadline, we had to record the book. I got so indulged in writing the book (much like I do with programming today) that I never ended up recording the audio for it. My teacher would give feedback to my mother saying that she got annoyed that I had flute lessons because I always left the stories on cliffhangers (although sometimes I did this for dramatic effect). That thought makes me smile, to have a story that brings that effect onto someone. I miss that, I miss being in a world of creativity, being able to bring a change to someone's life. As I have gotten better at programming I have been able to incorporate that creativity back, as well as through different mediums such as photography and music.", "/css/Assets/BlogImages/OneSmallChange/1.png", "Upon meeting Rob, he told me that I should write my own blog, put myself out there, document anything that I find challenging, as there will be other people in the same situation as myself who will have the same problems, the same hurdles, the same or more or less similar. That point really got me. I tend to read a lot of documentation and guides online. I like taking the reading approach to a lot of things, and I get used to how to interpret that information, however not everyone understands that, and I can relate to how it used to be at the beginning. Whether it be reading Microsoft docs, bootstrap docs, reading textbooks, and I'm one of those who still loves reading. However, some of the time when starting something new I am a penguin in the Sahara desert, and it requires a lot of prerequisites. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only .net stack developer that prefers C# over JS, if I document my process then hopefully at least one person will be able to relate and follow along. At the same time it gives me a goal to attain to, for example, last Sunday I made 2 desktop applications, both small, and with one of them I decided to record a video documentary of my progress, the program was made to give me a notification on my desktop when sound levels get too high (I use audio interfaces which are put off to the side and I cannot see if my sound levels are too high unless I look to the side), the other one was just a type racing application since the website I use to test my typing speed has a server in the US, and my ping was substantially high enough to drastically make my typing speed seem lower than it really is, so I made a client-side application and added cool things like a progress bar. randomly generated texts, progress updates, which I can now use when I am travelling without an internet connection. Now, if this is something you're interested in seeing or reading about, stay tuned since I may be releasing this sort of thing too. At the same time, I have to juggle two jobs, but this is my hobby.");
